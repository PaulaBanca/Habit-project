      "explanation" : "You will tap out the sequences on circles like the ones below.\n\nPlace one finger on each circle and give it a go! Tap the coloured circles.\nIn the example below, tap all the coloured circles at once.",
      "practice" : "Letâ€™s practice a simple sequence a few times.\n\nFollow the coloured circles.",
      "levels" : "To help you memorize the sequences, colours and sounds will guide you initially so you know which keys to press. Later on, you will tap out the sequences without any help.",

      "level3" : "Level 3:\n\nThe circles do not play any sounds.\n\nAt this level you should know the sequence by heart. Try now!",

      "devaluation1": "You will win coins during your app training. The coins will be deposited in 2 differen pots, one for the orange coins and one for the purple coins. After each practice, you will see how many coins you have accumulated.",
      "devaluation2": "Given the nature of the game, not every correct sequence will give you a coin. It is your task to discover the best way of performing the sequences to earn as many coins as possible during the app experiment. The more coins you make on the experiment, the more money you will receive for your participation in the end of the study.",
      "tutorial_completed" : "Now you are ready to start practising your sequences.\n\nYou have a month to master the sequences!\n\nGood luck!"
